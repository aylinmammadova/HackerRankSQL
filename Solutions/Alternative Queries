# 1. Draw The Triangle 1
P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
*
Write a query to print the pattern P(20).
SELECT RPAD('* ', LEVEL*2, '* ')
FROM DUAL
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 20
ORDER BY LEVEL DESC;

# 2. Draw The Triangle 2
P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *
Write a query to print the pattern P(20).
SELECT RPAD('* ',LEVEL*2, '* ')
FROM DUAL
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 20;
-- Without gaps between
SELECT RPAD('*',LEVEL, '*')
FROM DUAL
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 20;

# 3. Print Prime Numbers
Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to . Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand () character as your separator (instead of a space).
For example, the output for all prime numbers  would be: 2&3&5&7
SELECT LISTAGG(prime_number,'&') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY prime_number) AS NUMBERS
FROM(    
    SELECT l prime_number
    FROM (SELECT LEVEL l FROM DUAL CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 1000)
    ,(SELECT LEVEL m FROM DUAL CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 1000)
WHERE m <= l
GROUP BY l
HAVING COUNT(CASE l/m WHEN TRUNC(l/m) THEN 1 END) = 2
    );
