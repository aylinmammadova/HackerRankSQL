# 1. Population Census
Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the sum of the populations of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Asia'.
Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.
SELECT SUM(city.population)
FROM city 
JOIN country
ON city.countrycode = country.code
WHERE country.continent = 'Asia';

# 2. African Cities
Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Africa'.
Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.
SELECT city.name
FROM city 
JOIN country
ON city.countrycode = country.code
WHERE country.continent = 'Africa';

# 3. Average Population of Each Continent
Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and 
their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.
Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.
SELECT country.continent, FLOOR(AVG(city.population))
FROM city
JOIN country
ON city.countrycode = country.code
GROUP BY country.continent; 

# 4. The Report
You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.
Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark.
Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. 
The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically.
Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.
SELECT CASE WHEN grades.grade >= 8 THEN students.name
            ELSE 'NULL' END, grades.grade, students.marks
FROM students, grades
WHERE students.marks >= grades.min_mark and students.marks <= grades.max_mark
ORDER BY grades.grade desc, students.name asc;

# 5. Top Competitors
Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and 
name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which 
the hacker earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.
SELECT s.hacker_id, h.name
FROM hackers h
JOIN submissions s
ON h.hacker_id = s.hacker_id
JOIN challenges c
ON s.challenge_id = c.challenge_id
JOIN difficulty d
ON c.difficulty_level = d.difficulty_level
WHERE s.score = d.score
GROUP BY s.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, s.hacker_id;

# 6. Ollivander's Inventory
Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.
Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. 
Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. 
If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.
SELECT a.id, b.age, a.coins_needed, a.power
FROM wands a
JOIN wands_property b
ON a.code = b.code
JOIN (SELECT age, power, MIN(coins_needed) coins
     FROM wands A
     JOIN wands_property B
     ON A.code = B.code
     WHERE is_evil = 0
     GROUP BY age, power) AB
ON b.age = AB.age AND a.power = AB.power AND a.coins_needed = AB.coins
ORDER BY a.power DESC, b.age DESC;

# 7. Challenges
Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.
